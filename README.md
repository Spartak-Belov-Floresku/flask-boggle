# Boggle Game

The goal of the game is to get the highest point total. To gain points, players create words from a random assortment of letters in a 5x5 grid

Words can be created from adjacent letters â€“ that is, letters which are horizontal or vertical neighbors of each other as well as diagonals. 
The letters must connect to each other in the proper sequence to spell the word correctly. 
There is functionality to determine if a word can be constructed from a boggle board.
